# Programming-Notes
notes to reference now and in the future as i learn programming and the concepts around it

# JavaScript (JS)
* When comparing values of different types, JS converts the values to numbers firsst
* When doing comparisons betweem strings, JS goes character by character.
 
  Eg. 'glow' > 'glee' returns true. why? g == g, move on to next character in both words ('l', which are equal),
  then goes on and compares 'o' and 'e', where it shows 'o' is greater according to the Unicode indexing JS uses
